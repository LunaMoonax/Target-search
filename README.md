# ðŸ§¬ Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2025: Bioinformatics for Target & Primer Search

This repository contains the bioinformatics analysis for the **Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2025** team's project.

Work focuses on the genomic analysis of two tick-borne bacterial genera: *$Borrelia$* and *$Rickettsia$*.

The primary goal of this analysis is to:
* Identify target sequences for TIGR-Tas.
* Design and computationally validate primers for their detection.
